# Contoso-Currency-conversion-challange
While doing my initial Contoso project I noticed that the database contained a currency conversion table but since all sales were already in USD there was no need for the table when creating my Contoso dashboard project. Still, I wanted to try using this table as it allows for an interesting and challenging SQL problem. that is converting sales to a new currency. The main difficulty of this challenge comes from the fact that you have to round the sales date to the nearest month and then match that specific month to the appropriate average conversion rate. I used the Euro in this example, but you can easily edit the query to work for any currency by merely changing the CurrencyKey condition on the second join to have the currency key of your desired currency. This specific query demonstrates usage of several valuable SQL skills those being formatting output, joining multiple tables, creating subqueries, and using case statements.
